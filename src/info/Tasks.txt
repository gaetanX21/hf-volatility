Tasks:

- code poisson thinning to simulate inhomogeneous poisson point process OK
- use poisson thinning to simulate hawkes process OK

- hawkes calibration:
1) regression using least-squares to fit realized signature plot --> DO THIS IF YOU CARE ABOUT SIGNATURE PLOT
2) MLE --> DO THIS IF YOU CARE ABOUT MIMICKING ARRIVAL TIMES


--> we can compare both estimators
--> reg is supposed to be more stable (and easier to compute) then MLE

--> we can use this to calibrates hawkes on various assets/markets/time of day

Start with univariate modelling, then go bivariate!


Other things to look into microstructure noise:
- effet realised vol qui augmente quand tau diminue
- effet Epps
